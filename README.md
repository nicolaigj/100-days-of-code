## My project
This repository is a fork of Alexander Kallways 100-days-of-code repository and is intended to track my 100DaysOfx challenges I embark on. The way I structure this is by rounds of challenges, so the first round beginning 2018-04-03 I will do 100DaysOfCode and 100DaysOfHealth. Before the round I've specified the rules and written a manifest stating the 'why' and somewhat the 'how' in form if a outline of a plan.
