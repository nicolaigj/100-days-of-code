# Round 1 manifest

## Introduction
I stumbled upon this concept when Michael at Talk Python To Me offered the 100DaysOfCode course, I may have read about it before, but forgot about it. Researched the concept a bit and it really spoke to me, I want to change my coding habits and become a better programmer. My daily job is somewhat related to coding working with RPA-tools and some small coding projects, but most of the time is spent either managing projects or sysadmin stuff in Azure or at customers site. 

I'm also doing 100DaysOfHealth at the same time to change some of my eating habits, in general I'm a healthy and active person, but I like food and drinks a bit too much and tend to over eat, and that's something I'd like to work on. I love cooking and make everything from fresh ingredients, very little prefabricated food, so it's just the part of being more conscious about how much I'm eating or drinking.   

## Motivation
My motivation is to become a better programmer and create a good habit for side projects that can have value for me and others in the future. I have so many ideas of what to do, but lack of focus and persistence to complete any. 

For 100DaysOfHealth my motivation is to be more in control and create better habits as well as being more consistent in my training. I'm not seeking any miracles, just a tad more sustainable way of living. 

## Plan
### 100DaysOfCode
I'm not going to plan a single or several projects for the entire 100 days, and my plan might as well change entirely along the course. What I inititially want to become better at is front end development with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, so the first thing I want to create is a personal blog with a static site generator like Pelican in Python. This is just a thought of where to start, maybe I'll use another technology to accomplish my goal of doing more front end, but I'll think I'll start with Pelican and continue from there.
