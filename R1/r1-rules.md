# Rules of the 100 Days Of Health Challenge

## Main commitment
### *I will live a healthier life by focusing on better eating and training habits*

#### Start Date
Start date: 2018-04-03
End date: 2018-07-12

## Rules
1. I will be focused on improving my health in various ways every day.
2. I will tweet an update daily with the hashtags: #100DaysOfHealth #100DaysOfX and a day on which I am on, and with my thoughts/feelings on that day.
3. I will encourage at least 2 other people in the challenge daily.
4. I will work out at least 3 times a week
5. I will allow myself a small treat in form of food/drink/candy once a week if I want to. 
6. I will make an effort to buy healthy food (groceries) and to cook at home as much as I can.
7. I will NOT eat any junk food (e.g. chips, ice-cream, instant noodles, etc.)
8. I will NOT weigh myself during the challenge. It’s one of the most important rules because it switches focus from a results-oriented to a process-oriented one. Also it helps us appreciate and love our bodies and not to diminish our worth based on a number.
9. I will NOT drink sugary drinks as they are often a hidden source of an enormous amount of sugar we get daily – which means: soda (pop), juices, sweet coffee/tea drinks.
10. Rules are rules, but if one day I have a huge craving for some specific type of food, I will allow myself to eat it. The catch is that it will be a small amount.
11. I will drink at least 2 litres of water daily. 
12. I will minimize alcohol consumption to 3 beers or half a bottle wine a week. 
13. While eating out I will choose the healthier option.
