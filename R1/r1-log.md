## Log

### R1D1 
#### Code
Worked and travelled for 14 hours, so not much time to code. Started my pelican project: https://github.com/nicolaigj/pelican-blog

#### Health
Chose healthy all day, I usually have a croissant in the morning at the airport, but not today. 

### R1D2
#### Code
Got more than an hour of coding today. Figured out how to build a template in Pelican and started with bootstrap. 

#### Health
Had a workout with two of my colleagues here in Oslo, interval running in Frognerparken. Ran from the office to Frognerparken and did 2 x 10 intervals of 45 seconds sprinting and 15 seconds break. Had three course dinner, way too much food, could not finish. It was also quite meh. 

### R1D3
#### Coding
Just did an hour of coding while eating breakfast at the hotel. Building the navigation bar in my theme dynamically with jinja2, pretty cool! Did not write a lot of lines of code, spent some time reading documentation and code examples to learn the framework. 

#### Health
Had breakfast, one slice of bread with ham and cheese and a bowl of yoghurt, granola and berries. Pizza and beer at my company in the evening, but only had two beers instead of probably ten, and moderate pizza. 

### R1D4
#### Coding
Coded a half an hour at breakfast, trying to figure out what a page is in pelican, so I can render menu correctly. Finished the last half hour before bed, found some bugs in the menu and figured out what pages were. Tip of the day: Read the docs!

#### Health
Had a good day, resisted beers at work, but had a glass of wine to dinner, still 10% of what I would normally consume. No workout, only work :(
