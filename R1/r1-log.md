The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [2018-04-03].

## Log

### R1D1 
#### Code
Worked and travelled for 14 hours, so not much time to code. Started my pelican project: https://github.com/nicolaigj/pelican-blog

#### Health
Chose healthy all day, I usually have a croissant in the morning at the airport, but not today. 

### R1D2
#### Code
Got more than an hour of coding today. Figured out how to build a template in Pelican and started with bootstrap. 

#### Health
Had a workout with two of my colleagues here in Oslo, interval running in Frognerparken. Ran from the office to Frognerparken and did 2 x 10 intervals of 45 seconds sprinting and 15 seconds break. Had three course dinner, way too much food, could not finish. It was also quite meh. 

### R1D3
#### Coding
Just did an hour of coding while eating breakfast at the hotel. Building the navigation bar in my theme dynamically with jinja2, pretty cool! Did not write a lot of lines of code, spent some time reading documentation and code examples to learn the framework. 

#### Health
Had breakfast, one slice of bread with ham and cheese and a bowl of yoghurt, granola and berries. Pizza and beer at my company in the evening, but only had two beers instead of probably ten, and moderate pizza. 

### R1D4
#### Coding
Coded a half an hour at breakfast, trying to figure out what a page is in pelican, so I can render menu correctly. Finished the last half hour before bed, found some bugs in the menu and figured out what pages were. Tip of the day: Read the docs!

#### Health
Had a good day, resisted beers at work, but had a glass of wine to dinner, still 10% of what I would normally consume. No workout, only work :(

### R1D5
#### Code
Finished the menu for now, starting on creating template for the content. More importantly, I found the name for my blog, Nicode!

#### Health
Visited Mathallen in Oslo, had Fish and Chips, not the most healthy option, but since I read a review about the fish and chips a couple of months ago I could not resist. Didn't finish it all. Had 3 beers that day in total. Not the most healthy day, but in a normal situation I would've had a lot more.

### R1D6
#### Code
Getting more and more into bootstrap now, while developing my template I'm watching this [Bootstrap 4 tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnCmSXCZEpU), pretty good!

#### Health
Lazy day, didn't eat or move much, exept from a 40 minute walk. 

### R1D7
#### Code
Tried to code at breakfast, but windows update effectively stopped my plan of being effective in the morning. Ended up coding after work, a bit tired but I made it through. Working on list representation of the articles on the article page. 

#### Health
Good day, had wok with noodles for lunch. Today I'll do a workout at the hotel before dinner. Dinner will either be japanese at Izakaya or probably pizza at Villa Paradiso. 

### R1D8 It's my birtday!
#### Code
Spent time reading documentation, figuring out how to define a front image to display in the article list so it won't become a wall of text. 

#### Health
Worked out, ran about 5 km around Slottet. 

### R1D9 
#### Coding
No coding :(

#### Health
No exercise, but didn't eat anything unhealthy. Celebrated birthday with Ragnhild and a bottle of wine. 

### R1D10
#### Coding
Continued on templating index.html. Starting to get there with my article display. 

#### Health
Didn't have waffle or cake at lunch, or beer and snacks at friday meeting. Ate grilled entrecote with potatoes and salad and had a beer for dinner. 

### R1D11
#### Coding
Coded in the morning before bachelor party! Not an entire hour, but enough.

#### Health
Bachelor party, maaaaany beers and enough food. Bad day healthwise. 

### R1D12
#### Coding
Back to normal, coded now before bed. Working on pagination and stuff. Starting to get to a point where I consider putting it up in public. 

#### Health 
Good day, had a lot of vegetables for lunch and dinner. Went for the years first bike ride, 36 km. Felt good!

### R1D13
#### Coding
No coding, only commitments :(

#### Health
Didn't eat proper dinner, but nothing unhealthy altogether. 

### R1D14
#### Coding
Got an hour of code at work. Figuring out how to remove borders in list group item. 

#### Health
Dentist today, not easy eating lunch! Had dessert though, not that healthy, but it was the only way I could have some calories. 

### R1D15
I skipped a couple of days because of millitary service and no access to computer of any sort. Continue on day 15 even though it has passed more days in calendar time.

#### Coding
Started on coding on articles.html. 

#### Health
Nice to have a lot of vegetables after dry freezed food in the army. Had awesome homemade pasta and homemade spicy tomato sauce for dinner.
