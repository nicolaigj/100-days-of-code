The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [2018-04-03].

## Log

### R1D1 
#### Code
Worked and travelled for 14 hours, so not much time to code. Started my pelican project: https://github.com/nicolaigj/pelican-blog

#### Health
Chose healthy all day, I usually have a croissant in the morning at the airport, but not today. 

### R1D2
#### Code
Got more than an hour of coding today. Figured out how to build a template in Pelican and started with bootstrap. 

#### Health
Had a workout with two of my colleagues here in Oslo, interval running in Frognerparken. Ran from the office to Frognerparken and did 2 x 10 intervals of 45 seconds sprinting and 15 seconds break. Had three course dinner, way too much food, could not finish. It was also quite meh.
